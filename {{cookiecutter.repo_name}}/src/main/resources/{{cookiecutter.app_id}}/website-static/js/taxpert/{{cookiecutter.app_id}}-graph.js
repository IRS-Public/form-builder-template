// What {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} tells taxpert about itself that is *behaviour* rather than *words*.
//
// The workspace is configured from templates/fragments/taxpert-config.html, because every label it
// carries goes through Thymeleaf's `#{...}` and is therefore resolved per locale at build time. One
// thing cannot live in a template: the fact-graph port, which is functions over window.factGraph.
// So the fragment supplies the copy, this file supplies the code, and the fragment imports it.
//
// Every user-visible string here arrives through `t`, the translator the fragment hands in. There
// is no English literal below, and there should not be one: a literal here would be English in the
// Spanish build, because website-static/ is served verbatim and never passes through Thymeleaf.

 * The fact-graph port for this application.
 *
 * Reads need no options: the flow runtime sets `window.factGraph` and fires `fg-load` / `fg-update`
 * on `document`, which is what windowFactGraphAdapter() already defaults to. `save` is not
 * optional — a write that is not persisted is gone at the next navigation, and the library cannot
 * guess where this app keeps its graph.

/**
 * The outcomes the workspace follows, and the facts each one is made of.
 *
 * `rollupPath` is the one fact that *is* the outcome: the Outcome tracker draws a full ring once it
 * settles and a part-drawn one until then, so answering the flow visibly moves it. `outcome`
 * describes how to say the settled value — `boolean` here; `signed` and `enum` are the other kinds.
 *
 * Each section is a heading and the facts under it, in the order a person would check them. Keep
 * the rollup in its own section too: the expanded view then shows the answer beside its inputs.
 *
 * @param {(key: string) => string} t resolves a message key to this build's locale
