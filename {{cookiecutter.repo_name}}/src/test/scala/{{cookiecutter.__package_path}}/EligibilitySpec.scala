/** The determination, tested against the real fact dictionary rather than a mock of it.
  *
  * This is the pattern to copy for every rule your tool decides: build a graph, set the writable facts a taxpayer would
  * have answered, read the derived one. No flow, no browser, no HTML — a rule is a property of the fact dictionary, and
  * this is the level it is cheapest to be wrong at.
  *
  * Note the third case. A derived fact over an unanswered input is *incomplete*, not false, and the two mean different
  * things to a taxpayer: "you don't qualify" versus "we haven't asked yet". `.value` returns `None` for incomplete, so
  * assert on the Option rather than calling `.get`.
